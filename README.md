# Asynchrounous Programming
This repository will be used for studying asynchronous programming. The studying criteria is to understand how async programming can be more efficient doing the same work of a sync program, by using two methods that do the same operations, but one is doing asynchronously.
Since algorithms look like cooking recipes, I thought it would be a good idea to use a simple recipe to code the program.
