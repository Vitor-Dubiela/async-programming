# Asynchrounous Programming
This repository will be used for studying asynchronous programming. The studying goal is to understand how async programming can be more efficient doing the same work of a sync program, by using two methods that do the same operations, but one is using asynchronous code to do the tasks concurrently and the other is using sync code.
Since algorithms look like cooking recipes, I thought it would be a good idea to use a simple recipe to code the program.
