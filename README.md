# Why I Created This Repository? :thinking::thinking:
The will to create this repository came from a job's project that I was working on. The problem I faced required using non-blocking code to run the Sql queries, which I solved using asynchronous programming, and then, I decided that it would be a good idea to review what I studied from async programming. I hope this repository works for me - and you - as a studying object.

## But what kind of Project was that? 
* .NET Framework Project.
* Domain-Driven Design (DDD).
* Sql Server.

The Domain manages users and vacancies infos, allowing users to apply for jobs and the Employers to read the resum√© of their candidates.


# What Created This Problem? :scream:
The business logic used to get the candidates infos was blocking the code. Although the SELECT method was async, it was awaiting the query to finish, and as it was a lot of data to select, the code was being blocked.

# How To Solve It? :monocle_face:
To enhance the overall responsivennes of the application, avoiding performance bottlenecks, I used the C#'s Task Asynchronous Programming (TAP) Model, which provides a simplified approach for async programming.
